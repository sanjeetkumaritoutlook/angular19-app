Key Features of This Example:
1. Two-Way Binding with [(ngModel)]
Each input field is bound to a property of the user object using [(ngModel)].
Changes in the form fields update the user object automatically, and vice versa.
2. Validation
Required Fields: required ensures that the form fields are not left empty.
Password Validation: minlength="6" ensures the password is at least 6 characters.
Error Messages: Validation errors are displayed using *ngIf.
3. Real-Time Feedback
The preview section dynamically updates as the user types, showing the user object in JSON format.
The submit button is disabled until the form is valid.
4. Handling Checkboxes
The preferences object tracks the user's preferences for newsletters and notifications using [(ngModel)].
5. Form Submission
On form submission, the onSubmit() method logs the user object to the console and displays a success message.
