error:
Property 'required' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['required'].ngtsc(4111)


so use ['required']

Explanation
1. FormGroup and FormControl
The registrationForm is created as a FormGroup using the FormBuilder.
Each field (name, email, password, terms) is a FormControl with validators.
2. Validators
Validators.required: Ensures the field is not empty.
Validators.email: Checks for a valid email format.
Validators.minLength(6): Ensures the password is at least 6 characters long.
Validators.requiredTrue: Ensures the checkbox for terms is checked.
3. Dynamic Error Messages
Error messages are conditionally displayed using *ngIf and the errors property of each FormControl.
The touched property ensures errors only appear after the user interacts with the field.
4. Submit Button State
The submit button is disabled until the form is valid
<button type="submit" [disabled]="registrationForm.invalid">Register</button>

5. Form Submission
On form submission, the onSubmit method checks if the form is valid and logs the form value to the console.
6. Live Preview
The registrationForm.value is displayed in JSON format for real-time feedback.
----------
Why Use Reactive Forms?
Better Control: Fine-grained control over validation logic and error handling.
Scalability: Ideal for complex forms with dynamic fields or custom validators.
Dynamic Forms: Allows for programmatic creation of fields and validation rules.
-----------
Dynamic Forms refer to forms that are generated programmatically at runtime rather than being hardcoded in the template. This means the form fields, validation rules, and other form elements (like checkboxes, radio buttons, or dropdowns) are created based on some external data or logic, rather than being predefined in the HTML.
